    "bio": "I am a front-end developer by my work and passion, I love creating interactive, cool, creative and beautiful apps. I have basically created apps using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Reactjs, Bootstrap and you can check them in the below section of my portfolio. I am basically a fun-loving, chilled person and like to hang out with friends and explore new places. I like singing, listening to music and watching cricket apart from coding of course. If you find my portfolio interesting enough and you want to work with me, do not hesitate to drop a mail at my email id mentioned in the contact section. You can also call me on my contact number mentioned.",
